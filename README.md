<h3>Evolutionary Algorithms Guided by Erdős–Rényi Complex Networks</h3>
<br>
This repository contains the implementation of evolutionary algorithm that integrates Erdős–Rény Complex Networks to regulate population crossovers. <br>The population of the evolutionary computation is represented as a complex network, where nodes represent individual solutions and links represent crossovers among solutions. 
The algorithm enhances solutions by creating new links among nodes, thereby guiding the population dynamics and optimizing problem-solving processes. The experimentation compares four instances of the traditional and well-known optimization problems Travel Sales Problem (TSP), applying both the traditional evolutionary algorithm and the proposed algorithm. 

The results indicate that the strategy guided by a complex dynamic network outperforms the traditional algorithm. The proposed model demonstrates improved convergence and shorter execution times. Strategies based on complex networks reveal that network characteristics provide valuable information for solving optimization problems. 

Therefore, complex networks can regulate the decision-making process, similar to optimizing problems. This work emphasizes that the network structure is crucial in adding value to decision-making.
